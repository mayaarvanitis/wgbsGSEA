# Introduction

Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is a powerful technique that provides single-base resolution of DNA methylation across the entire genome. This allows researchers to investigate methylation changes in a comprehensive manner, uncovering patterns that may influence gene expression and contribute to diseases such as cancer.

The purpose of this analysis is to:
1. **Annotate differentially methylated CpG sites** with their corresponding genes.
2. **Perform gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)** using `methylGSA` to identify pathways and biological processes associated with methylation changes.
3. **Compare enrichment results** using both logistic regression (methylglm) and the GSEA method (methylRRA).

# Step 1: Install and Load Necessary Libraries

First, we need to install and load the required R packages. This ensures that all the functions we use throughout the analysis are available.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Install packages if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install(c("methylGSA", "biomaRt", "GenomicRanges", "annotatr"))

# Load necessary libraries
library(GenomicRanges)
library(GenomicFeatures)
library(AnnotationDbi)
library(msigdb)
library(ExperimentHub)
library(GSEABase)
library(msigdbr)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(methylGSA)
library(org.Mm.eg.db)
```

# Data import and Preprocessing 
In this step, we import the WGBS data containing information on CpG sites and their differential methylation status. We filter CpG sites based on their p-values to identify those that show significant methylation changes.

```{r}
# Load the full differential methylation data 
diff_data <- readr::read_tsv("data_maya/WTvsG34R_CRX_10W.diff_meth.tsv.gz", col_names = TRUE)

# Display the structure of the dataset
head(diff_data)
summary(diff_data)

# Filter significant CpGs with p-value < 0.05
significant_cpgs <- diff_data %>% filter(pvalue < 0.05)

# Separate CpGs into hypermethylated and hypomethylated groups
hyper_cpgs <- significant_cpgs %>% filter(meth.diff > 0)
hypo_cpgs <- significant_cpgs %>% filter(meth.diff < 0)

# Display the dimensions of the two groups
cat("Number of hypermethylated CpGs:", nrow(hyper_cpgs), "\n")
cat("Number of hypomethylated CpGs:", nrow(hypo_cpgs), "\n")
```

# Gene Annotation Using biomaRt

This step involves annotating the significant CpGs with gene information using the biomaRt package, which allows us to query the Ensembl database.

```{r}
# Connect to the Ensembl database for mouse genome annotation
ensembl <- useMart("ensembl", dataset = "mmusculus_gene_ensembl", host = "https://asia.ensembl.org")
```

Perform these steps for both the hypermethylated and hypomethylated CpGs. 
```{r}
# STEP 1: Construct chromosomal_region in the query dataset ==============================
# For hypermethylated CpGs -------
hyper_cpgs <- hyper_cpgs %>% mutate(query_id = paste0(chr, "_", start, "_", end), chromosomal_region = paste0(chr, ":", start, "-", end))
# For hypomethylated CpGs -------
hypo_cpgs <- hypo_cpgs %>% mutate(query_id = paste0(chr, "_", start, "_", end), chromosomal_region = paste0(chr, ":", start, "-", end))

# STEP 2: Annotate the CpG sites  ==============================
# For hypermethylated CpGs -------
hyper_annotations <- getBM(
  attributes = c("chromosome_name", "start_position", "end_position", "external_gene_name"),
  filters = "chromosomal_region",
  values = hyper_cpgs$chromosomal_region,
  mart = ensembl
)
# For hypomethylated CpGs -------
hypo_annotations <- getBM(
  attributes = c("chromosome_name", "start_position", "end_position", "external_gene_name"),
  filters = "chromosomal_region",
  values = hypo_cpgs$chromosomal_region,
  mart = ensembl
)

# STEP 3: Add chromosomal_region column to the result ==============================
# For hypermethylated CpGs -------
hyper_annotations <- hyper_annotations %>% mutate(chromosomal_region = paste0(chromosome_name, "_", start_position, "_", end_position))
# For hypomethylated CpGs -------
hypo_annotations <- hypo_annotations %>% mutate(chromosomal_region = paste0(chromosome_name, "_", start_position, "_", end_position))

# STEP 4: Filter out rows with NA in the external_gene_name column ==============================
# For hypermethylated CpGs -------
hyper_annotations <- hyper_annotations %>% filter(!is.na(external_gene_name) & external_gene_name != "" & !grepl("^\\s*$", external_gene_name))
# For hypomethylated CpGs -------
hypo_annotations <- hypo_annotations %>% filter(!is.na(external_gene_name) & external_gene_name != "" & !grepl("^\\s*$", external_gene_name))

# STEP 5: Display the first few rows to confirm
head(hyper_annotations)
